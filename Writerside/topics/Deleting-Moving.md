# Deleting, moving or manually adding projects

## Delete a project
You can delete a project by hovering over the project name in the Projects list and pressing the delete button.

<note>
Deleting a project does not delete the project folder or its contents. It simply removes it from the project list.

You can add it back at any stage by adding a new project and pointing to the same folder.

## Moving a project
Once a project has been created, you cannot change the project's path. If you want to move it elsewhere

- Delete the project from Vizitest.
- Move project to the new location.
- Create a new Vizitest project, pointing to the new location.

## Manually adding an existing project
If you already have a Vizitest project (for example, someone emailed you a ZIP file of the folder), then you unzip and store the folder on your machine and create a new Vizitest project, specifying the folder path.
