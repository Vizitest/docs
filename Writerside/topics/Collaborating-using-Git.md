# Collaborating using Git

Our goal is to allow people to collaborate on testing projects while at the same time being aware that many companies do not want any data being sent into the Cloud.

The way we addressed this is to use Git as the primary means of collaboration. The level of Git knowledge required is minimal.

While this approach is a little less simple for QA staff than providing a Cloud based solution, we believe that the benefits are significant. To alleviate potential pain, we will add simple UI based capabilities in the future.

## An example repository
There is a [preconfigured project Vizitest Learn](https://github.com/Vizitest/vizitest-learn) on GitHub.

To execute these tests, it assumes that you have set up the local test server as [described here](The-Test-Server.md).
