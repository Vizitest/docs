# Status & Roadmap

## Short term roadmap
Available during the next eight weeks.

- Copy, paste and duplication of test configurations, components and groups
- Secrets and Variables - similar to Postman.
- Support for oAuth and Basic Authentication
- OpenAPI ingestion. Will allow instant creation of test configurations based from any OpenAPI specification.
- Support for Binary and Form mime types
- Inline Javascript for custom assertions and passing response data from one endpoint as input to a subsequent request.

## Longer Term
### Phase 1

- Server Side Scripting - Pre- and post-request hooks. Examine and manipulate data. generate your own dynamic test cases from databases, lookup tables etc. Packages/modules initially for Typescript with Java and C# coming immediately afterwards.
- Regression Testing - integrate tests into any CI/CD workflow.

### Phase 2
Available in the 3 months following Phase 1.

- Mocking - Create a mocking server for your API before you have any real data. Ideal for both developers and QA. Populate mocking data from response snapshots or from OpenAPI example data.
- New components for gRPC, Sockets and GraphQL
- Load testing - Create load profiles to test how your API performs under real-world conditions.
