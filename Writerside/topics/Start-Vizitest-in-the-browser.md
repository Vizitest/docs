# Starting Vizitest in the browser

The Vizitest frontend currently runs in a browser window. We will soon be delivering this as a self-contained application.

In the meantime, we recommend that you bookmark the Vizitest browser page.

If Vizitest is not running and you do not know how to start it, please [stop and start the Vizitest services](Vizitest-services.md), which will open Vizitest in the browser.

We recommend you bookmark the page.
