# Overview

## Reference Guide

Vizitest fulfills a very similar purpose to Postman with some major differences.

- Collaboration is Git based, so API information is never sent into the Cloud.
- All supporting services run exclusively on a local PC, so you have full control over all security aspects.
- It has powerful testing capabilities for simple and complex scenarios.
- It supports scripting in the programming language of your choice.
- It has a modern, canvas based UI.
