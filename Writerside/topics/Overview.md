# Getting Started

## Service Monitor
Vizitest runs in a web client and talks to a locally installed backend service. Please refer to the [Vizitest Service Monitor](Vizitest-services.md) for more information.

## Learning Step by step
We recommend working through the following sections in the user guide. This will give you a solid understanding of Vizitest. There are also instructions on how to install a simple web server that accompanies the user guid steps.

- [The Test Manager](Test-Manager.md)
- [The Test Editor](Test-Editor.md)

## Vizitest Learn Project
You can also install the Vizitest Learn repository, a Vizitest project that contains some preconfigured tests. Please go to [The Test Server](The-Test-Server.md) for details.

## TLDR
We recommend reading the Test Manager and Test Editor sections. These contain some hands-on examples and a test server you can install locally.

The key steps when starting out with Vizitest are...

- [Add a Project](Add-new-project.md) in the Test Manager.
- [Create an API Configuration](API-Configurations.md) and define at least one Server.
- [Create a Test Configuration](Adding-a-test-configuration.md) in the Test Manager.
- [Open your new Test Configuration](Edit-a-test-configuration.md)
- [Configure your test](Test-Editor.md) in the Test Editor.

You can press the blue ? icon in the canvas components where you will find a video and relevant documentation links.
