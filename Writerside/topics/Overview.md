# Getting Started

Vizitest fulfills a very similar purpose to Postman with some major differences.

- You can create test cases without writing any code.
- Vizitest can auto-generate test cases for you.
- Collaboration is Git based, so API information is never sent into the Cloud.
- All supporting services run exclusively on a local PC, so you have full control over all security aspects.
- It has a modern, canvas based UI.

## Getting started
We recommend reading the Test Manager and Test Editor sections. These contain some hands-on examples and a test server you can install locally.

The key steps when starting out with Vizitest are...

- [Add a Project](Add-new-project.md) in the Test Manager.
- [Create an API Configuration](API-Configurations.md) and define at least one Server.
- [Create a Test Configuration](Adding-a-test-configuration.md) in the Test Manager.
- [Open your new Test Configuration](Edit-a-test-configuration.md)
- [Configure your test](Test-Editor.md) in the Test Editor.

You can press the blue ? icon in the canvas components where you will find a video and relevant documentation links.
