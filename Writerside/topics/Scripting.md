# Scripting

<note>
Scripting is not yet available but we are working on it!

Because Vizitest handles test cases management and tests without having to write code, the amount of scripting you need to manage real testing is reduced, often to zero.

Nevertheless, scripting is often important for special cases where you want to manipulate data or provide your own custom assertions.

We will offer two distinct scripting types.

## Server Side 

- For more sophisticated scenarios or where you want to use a language other than Javascript. 
- Use any programming language to create your scripts.
- Manipulate request data before test case executions.
- Create your own assertions based on the response data received for test cases.

## Javascript

- You will typically use Javascript for simple use cases where the server side setup overhead is unnecessary.
