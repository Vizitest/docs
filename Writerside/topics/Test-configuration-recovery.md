# Test configuration recovery

Should you want to recover an earlier version of a test configuration, you should go to the project folder in your file explorer/finder. You can find the path to the project folder by pressing the pencil icon in the Project box at the top of the left sidebar. Make sure the project is open first.

You can then locate the test configuration by opening the folders and child folders until you find the folder whose name matches the test configuration.

You should see a list of ```.tconfig``` files. You can delete any of these files, leaving the one you want to load according to the date.

With the test configuration open in Vizitest, reload the browser page.

We will be introducing file recovery through the UI so avoid the need for this.
