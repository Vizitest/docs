The Installer is an AppImage. AppImages require FUSE version 2 to run. Many distributions have a working FUSE setup out-of-the-box. However if it is not working for you, you may need to install and configure FUSE manually. See <a href="https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/FUSE">the FUSE page</a> for instructions.

**Redhat Enterprise Linux 9** - You should install ```libglvnd-opengl``` before running the installer.
