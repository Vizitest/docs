# Add new project

A project stores API and Test configurations organized into groups.

## Project folder
Before you create your new project, prepare a folder where the Vizitest project data should be stored. This can be anywhere on your machine,

## Git
You may want to initialise this folder as a git repository. This will allow you to collaborate with others. 

All Vizitest data is stored as text files, so it works well with Git.

## Create the project
To add a new project, click the + button next to **Projects**.

1. Enter a project name, such as **Vizitest Learn**. This can only contain valid file name characters.
2. Provide the name of a folder where your project will exist. This can be anywhere on your machine but it must be a valid, absolute path and must already exist,
3. Enter an optional description.
4. Choose an optional color. The color only servers as a visual aid to easily differentiate projects from one another.

When you click **Confirm**, a ```.vizitest``` folder will be created that contains all project related information. 

You will now see your newly created project in the left sidebar. It should be automatically selected and ready to work with.

You can also see that a group has been created. More about groups shortly.

## Editing the project
You can change the project name, description and color later by pressing the pencil icon in the bottom right corner of the Project name box (see above image).

You cannot change the project path once created.
