# Add new project

A project stores API and Test configurations organized into groups.

Initially, you will not have any projects, so let's create one.

To add a new project, click the + button next to **Projects**.

1. Enter a project name, such as **Vizitest Learn**. This can only contain valid file name characters.
2. Provide the name of a folder where your project will exist. This can be anywhere on your machine but it must be a valid, absolute path.
3. Enter an optional description.
4. Choose an optional color. The color only servers as a visual aid to easily differentiate projects from one another.

When you click **Confirm**, a ```.vizitest``` folder will be created that contains all project related information. 

You will now see your newly created project in the left sidebar. It should be automatically selected and ready to work with.

You can also see that a group has been created. More about groups shortly.
