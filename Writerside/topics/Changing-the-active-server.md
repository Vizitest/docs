# Changing the active server

Vizitest lets you centrally select which server you wish your tests to use.

Each API configuration in the left sidebar has a dropdown beneath it that indicates which server is currently active. Press then dropdown button to change the active server.

The selected server will then be used by all test configurations as the server that should be tested against.
