# Project and test locations

When you create projects and test configurations, these will be stored in the folder you specified when you [created your project](Add-new-project.md).

The structure you see in the Test Manager is reflected in the project folder. Each test manager group is a folder, whose sub-folders are individual test configurations or child groups.

Individual test configurations are also folders.
